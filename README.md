(GATE is a simulation software developed by the OpenGATE collaboration. See http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/)

- GATE_install.sh: Installation script for Geant4, ROOT and GATE

- GATE_parallel.sh: Small script to parallelize GATE execution on multiple cores. Not universal, it was design for a specific use of GATE.
